# **OverWatch2Randomizer**
OverWatch 2 Custom Match Stats Randomizer 
## Instructions 

Run the overwatch Overwatch2 Randomizer1.1.1.py
It will spit out an "Randomized.txt."
Open the .txt 
Control A then close the .txt
In OverWatch2 Go Play > Custom Games > Create>Setting
Click the orange Import Setting button
Done! 

You have a randomized deathmatch ready to play 
Gather your friends and enjoy the Chaos

## If altering the setting/gamemode and the stats are lost
Altering is simple, change what you'd like in game. Press the copy setting button in game and paste it into a .txt
I suggest editing a stat on Anna so making it line up more easily. 
Once everything looks good remain your .txt to "Base.txt" run the randomizer and done!
